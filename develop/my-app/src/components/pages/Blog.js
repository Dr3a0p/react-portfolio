      These are a couple of projects i worked on with really great classmates.

1. What 2 Eat/ Tasty
this was a very fun project to work on not only did this project teach me 
how to proactively code within an interconnected work area but I was also able to practice API requests. This application gives you the choice to eat in or find a place nearby using google maps to locate resturaunts around your area! If you choose to eaat in, you'll simply type in and search for whatever you're craving. An example would be maybe you're in the mood for chicken. After clicking the search button, you'll be given recipes you can cook from home. Maybe there's a recipe you want to save for later, you're also given the exact link towards said recipe!

2.Floral Frenzy!
This was more of a playful, fun creative project where we used MYSQL database to input and save data for our functionality. We also incorporated Handlebars.js for styling and lastly Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
This application's storyline is allowing the user to play a match game where the user is a gardener matching up flowers from their garden by symbols and colors! If there are multiple users playing they may also have the choice to chat using our chatbox. When the game has ended it'll throw out the highest scores with the users names!
